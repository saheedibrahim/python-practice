**************************
CS1101 - Programming Assignment Unit 4
**************************

Do Exercise 6.4 from your textbook using recursion and the is_divisible function from Section 6.4.  Your program may assume that both arguments to is_power are positive integers. Note that every positive integer that has an exponent of 0 is a power of "1". This includes "0" and "1", itself.

A number, a, is a power of b if it is divisible by b and a/b is a power of b. Write a function called is_power that takes parameters a and b and returns True if a is a power of b. Note: you will have to think about the base case.

You should submit a script file and a plain text output file (.txt) that contains the test output. Multiple file uploads are permitted. Donâ€™t forget to include descriptive comments in your Python code.

**************************
1. Does the submission include the is_divisible function from Section 6.4 of the textbook?
2. Does the submission implement an is_power function that takes two arguments?
3. Does the is_power function call is_divisible?
4. Does the is_power function call itself recursively?
5. Does the is_power function include code for the base case of the two arguments being equal?
6. Does the is_power function include code for the base case of the second argument being "1"?
7. Does the submission include correct output for the five test cases?
